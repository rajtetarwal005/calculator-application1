This Java program is a simple expression calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions containing numbers and basic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
while handling parentheses correctly. It uses two stacks—one for numbers and another for operators—to process the expression according to operator precedence.
The program reads the input character by character, extracting numbers and handling operators based on their precedence. When it encounters parentheses, 
it ensures that expressions inside them are evaluated first. Once all characters are processed, the remaining operations are computed to produce the final result. 
This approach ensures correct evaluation following mathematical rules (BODMAS/PEMDAS).
